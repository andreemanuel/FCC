                <p>Two years ago, slum-born Joko “Jokowi” Widodo was elected Indonesia’s President, becoming the first leader elected outside of the country’s narrow political and military elite. The kindly Jakarta governor, with his pronounced Javanese accent and reputation for consulting with the poor before making policy decisions, became a vessel for progressive Indonesian hopes of building a prosperous and tolerant country.</p>

                <p>oko Widodo, also known as Jokowi, is an Indonesian politician who is the seventh and current President of Indonesia. Elected in July 2014 as the first Indonesian president to not come from an elite political or military background, he was previously the Mayor of Surakarta from 2005 to 2012, and the Governor of Jakarta from 2012 to 2014.</p>
                <p>He achieved national prominence in 2009 for his work as the Mayor of Surakarta. A member of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), he was its candidate for the 2012 Jakarta gubernatorial election, alongside Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (often known as Ahok) as his running mate. Defeating incumbent Fauzi Bowo, he took office in October 2012 and reinvigorated Jakarta politics, with publicized blusukan visits (unannounced spot checks) and improving the city's bureaucracy, reducing corruption in the process. He also introduced years-late programs to improve quality of life in the city, including universal health-care, dredging the city's main river to reduce flooding, and inaugurating construction of the city's subway system.</p>
                <p>Seen as a rising star in Indonesian politics, PDI-P nominated Jokowi for the 2014 presidential election. Winning a majority of the popular vote, he was named president-elect on 22 July 2014, to bitter protest from his rival Prabowo Subianto, who disputed the outcome and withdrew from the race before the count was completed.</p>
                <p>In a time where the political and cultural landscape of the country was in the middle of an identity crisis, with the population fed up with corrupt leaders who dole out sweet promises but ultimately serve no purpose but their own agenda, his emergence rejuvenated the hopes of the people, especially the young millenials, who all of a sudden have a political figure to look up to.</p>
                <p>He has truly revived the republic.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Born into a poor family in the city of Surakarta, Widodo faced his share of struggles as a member of the underprivileged section of the society. Because of the family’s dire financial situations he had to start working as a young boy to support his family and to pay for his own education. Hard working and intelligent, he studied hard and, in 1985, graduated with a degree in forestry engineering from the prestigious Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, where his work included studies and research on the use of plywood. </p>
                    <p>
                    He began work at PT Kertas Kraft Aceh, a state-owned firm in the province of Aceh, but he soon became uninterested in his activities in the firm and returned home. He then began working in his grandfather's furniture factory before establishing his own company, Rakabu, whose namesake is his first child.

                    The company's products were successful in international markets. Products were sold, for example, in France where the goods first established a presence in the European market. It was a French customer named Bernard who gave Joko Widodo the nickname he is famous for, 'Jokowi'. Ultimately he decided to become a politician and promote reform in his home town, Surakarta, after seeing the neat layouts of some European cities while promoting his furniture there.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once he entered politics, his good-natured character along with his genuine passion for leading justly, led to his and, coincidentally, Indonesia's meteoric rise. With his pronounced Javanese accent and reputation for consulting with the poor before making policy decisions, he quickly became a vessel for progressive Indonesian hopes of building a prosperous and tolerant country.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Jokowi's policies during the seven years that he was mayor of Surakarta included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Building new traditional markets & renovating existing markets
                        </li>
                        <li>Constructing a 7-km city walk with a 3-meter wide pedestrian walkway along Surakarta's main street</li>
                        <li>Revitalizing the Balekambang and Sriwedari parks</li>
                        <li>Stricter regulations on cutting down trees along the city's main streets</li>
                        <li>Rebranding Surakarta as a center of Javanese culture and tourism under the tagline 'The Spirit of Java'
                        </li>
                        <li>Promoting the city as a center for meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions</li>
                        <li>The blusukan culture, the manner in which Jokowi made impromptu visits to certain areas to listen to people's issues</li>
                        <li>Prohibiting his family members from bidding for city projects, therefore suppressing risk of corruption</li>
                        <li>Healthcare & education insurance program for all residents</li>
                        <li>A local bus rapid transmit system named Batik Solo Trans</li>
                        <li>Solo Techno Park, which helped support the Esemka Indonesian car project</li>
                    </ul>  
                    <p>His supporters pointed to rapid positive changes in Surakarta under his leadership and the branding the city with the motto 'Solo: The Spirit of Java'. In 2010, he was reelected for his second term, once more running with Hadi. Such was his positive influence during his term that the incumbent pair won 90.09 percent of the votes - losing in only a single polling station.</p>

                    <p>Jokowi won the 2012 gubernatorial election in Jakarta after a runoff round against incumbent Fauzi Bowo. His main agenda involved improving the city's infrastructure while also improving the livelihood of the poor. He aims to make Jakarta not only a modern and sophisticated city, but also a sophisticated community, competing with other giants in the region, like Kuala Lumpur and Singapore.</p>
                    <p>Some of his other ground-breaking policies as Governor include: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Education: 
                            Educational programme
                            Jokowi launched KJP, shorts of Kartu Jakarta Pintar (Smart Jakarta Card) that gives an allowance  for buying books and uniforms for the underprivileged.</li>
                        <li>Public transportation: 
                            Jokowi inaugurated the construction of the Jakarta MRT, which was previously delayed for years.</li>
                        <li>Financial reforms: 
                            Taxes and the provincial budget of Jakarta increased significantly from Rp 41 trillion in 2012 to Rp 72 trillion in 2014.</li>
                        <li>Transparency: 
                            Jokowi and his vice governor, Ahok, publicized their monthly salary and the provincial budget, and also initiated programs aimed towards transparency, such as online taxes, e-budgeting, and e-purchasing. </li>
                        <li>Flood control: 
                            Jakarta is infamous for  its massive floodings during monsoon season, mainly caused by heavy pollution blocking waterways. Jokowi initiated dredging and normalization projects in major reservoirs  to reduce flooding. </li>

                    <p>
                        Joko Widodo won a close victory of 53.15 percent of the vote, to Prabowo's 46.85 percent . It was one of the closest Presidential Elections ever in the country between himself and former President Suharto's son-in-law. After his victory, Jokowi stated that, growing up under the authoritarian and corrupt New Order regime, he would have never expected someone with a lower-class background to become president.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jokowi took a while to adjust to his new position. Armed with an agenda full of bold policies, it took a couple of years for his plans to fully begin to get traction. Now, nearing the end of his first term, national pride is on a high, and the people love him for the good work he's done. Some of the highlights are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Splurging on infrastructure. Indonesia has many natural riches, but a weak infrastructure means there is no way to fully reap its benefits. Jokowi immediately began to build seaports, airports, roads, and railways, sacrificing spending allocation from elsewhere.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Strict policies in defending its maritime sovereignity, envisioning Indonesia as a strong maritime force. Indonesia and China have some territory disputes in the South China Sea, and Indonesia have taken a strong stance in defending their claims.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Capital punishment for drug traffickers, declaring a state emergency on drugs. The incompetence and corruption that usually associated with the National Police have begun to erode over his presidency, and a strong, unrelenting image forming in its place.</strong></li>
                    </ul>
