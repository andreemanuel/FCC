Javascript display/output:
    - into HTML element -> innerHTML
        document.getElementByID("id")
    - into HTML output -> document.write()
        convenient for testing purposes
        document.write();   
    - into alert box -> window.alert()
    - into browser console -> console.log()
        for debugging

A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer
These instructions are called STATEMENTS

STATEMENTS are comprised of:
    - values 
        -literal
            -numbers
            -strings
        -variable
    - operators

            ( + - * / )
        -assignment operator
            ( = )
    - expressions
        a combination of values, variables, and operator that computes a value
            eg: 5 * 10
    - keywords
        listed down below, they identify what actions are to be performed
    - comments
These statements are executed one by one, in order they are written;
Statements are separated by semicolons;
Code blocks are grouped within curly brackets {}, they define statements that are to be
executed together;
